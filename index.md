# Politician Tweets Analysis
## Introduction

As we all know, that Twitter is a important social media among celebrities. Also, recently, it has been put into a hot topic for text analysis. Since I'm pretty new to natural language processing, I think it would be fun to do some analysis on tweets. With the hottest topic this year except COVID-19, which is **presendential election**, I decided to crawl few iconic politician candidates from both repulican and democrat to see if it is possible to guess a tweet is posted by whom.
